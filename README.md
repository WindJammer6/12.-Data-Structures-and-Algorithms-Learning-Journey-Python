My learning journey of Data Structures and Algorithms in Python (work in progress)

## Thoughts on starting this learning journey
Back before I started programming,  I was introduced to a website for programmers to test their skills called LeetCode, which provides coding interview questions for coders
to try out. Curious, I went to look at the questions and found myself overwhelmed by how bizzare the questions look. I took a look around the internet to see how people solve
LeetCode questions and realised they understood this important programming concept that I haven't touched before - Data Structures and Algorithms.

Hence the birth of this repository, for me to bridge this gap.

(Funnily enough, when I first looked at LeetCode I had no idea how to navigate their website. I saw they had an answer template where you can type in your code answers but 
it contained many different kinds of programming languages. Obviously I went for the one I knew, Python. But then there was 2 options, Python and Python3. Then I looked at
the starting code (at the time I didn't know about Object-Oriented Programming and Classes yet) and I couldn't tell which was the one I was supposed to use. Furthermore, I 
was literally unable to understand any of the questions and give any relevant answer. So as you can see, this is how disastrous my first LeetCode experience was. (Eventually I found out I was using Python3, which I'm pretty sure is the version everyone using Python is using, after copy-pasting some of the usual codes I've written and asking ChatGPT hahaha...))

there are thousands different kinds of data structures and algorithms out there the ones here are the usual starting ones the teach to new programmers to familiarise them to DSA

Learning and Practices are both organised under each folder for their respective Data Structure/Algorithm.
