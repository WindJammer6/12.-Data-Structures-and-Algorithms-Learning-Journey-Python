What is the concept around Recursion?
Recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions 
to smaller instances of the same problem. Recursive function works and are functions that calls itself
within the function.

Real life scenario:
5 people queuing for a pizza shop

PIZZASHOP |  MADHAV(1), YANA(2), AARAV(3), SHEILA(4), MEERA(5)....

The pizza shop owner gave 1 bread to MADHAV, 2 bread to YANA and so on (1 more bread to each person down
the queue) to the people in the queue to compensate for their time (based on position in the queue) 
to wait.

The pizza owner also decided to give a 10% discount to people in the queue if they can figure out
the sum of total bread given to people in front and inclusive of them. How can we do this for everyone
by recursion?

Well, MEERA is smart but lazy, and thought that she will just ask SHEILA for her answer to this question
so she can just add her number of bread (5) to SHEILA's answer to get her own answer. SHEILA thought this 
was smart and decided to the same and ask AARAV for his answer and so on. 

Until we reach MADHAV who has a clear and simple answer of 1 number of bread as his answer. He tells this
to YANA, YANA tells AARAV, and all the way to MEERA which got her number as 15.

How does this look like mathematically to answer the quesiton 'find sum numbers 1 to 5'?
(find sum numbers 1 to 5) = 5 + (find sum numbers 1 to 4)
(find sum numbers 1 to 4) = 4 + (find sum numbers 1 to 3)
(find sum numbers 1 to 3) = 3 + (find sum numbers 1 to 2)
(find sum numbers 1 to 2) = 2 + (find sum numbers 1 to 1)

(find sum numbers 1 to 1) = 1, quite clear cut as an answer.

In a recursive approach/function, you are need do these 3 steps:
1. Divide a bigger problem into smaller and simpler problems
2. Find a base condition with a simple answer. (This base condition is a criteria for recursion to happen
   btw, as you need the base condition to tell the program when to stop the recursive loops and arrive 
   at a final output)
3. Return or roll back base condition answer to solve all sub problems
