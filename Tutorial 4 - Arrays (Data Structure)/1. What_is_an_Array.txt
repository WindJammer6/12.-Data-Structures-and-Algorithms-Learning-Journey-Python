Whats an Array?
An Array is a collection of similar data elements stored at contiguous memory locations.

Big O Notation of Time and Space Complexity for Array Data Structures:

Data Structures	 |   Space Complexity  |	        Average Case Time Complexity
                      |                     |    Access	  Search	 Insertion 	  Deletion
    Array	        |         O(n)	  |     O(1)	   O(n)	   O(n)	    O(n)

Static vs Dynamic Arrays:

Static Arrays are immutable. Upon creation, have a fixed size (lets say, 5), and cannot the size 
cannot be modified. (If you try insert/delete elements the computer program will give you an Array)

Dynamic Arrays are mutable. They can vary their size. (it allows inserting/deleting of new elements to
the Array) How exactly it does this under the hood is a little complicated and not very important.
(sth about shifting of the whole array to a new space with more space/memory to store more/incoming 
elements)

In Python, Dynamic Arrays are implemented as Lists and Static Arrays are implemented as Tuples.

In Other Programming Languages like Java and C++, Dynamic and Static Arrays are implemented differently 
as well.

                |     Python    |       Java       |       C++
Static Array    |     Tuple     |   Native array   |   Native array
Dynamic Array   |      List     |    Array list    |   std::vector

Difference between List (Python's implementation of an array) and Array (Programming Data Structure,
but can be implmented via Python Libraries such as NumPy) in Python:

S.No.
 1	List is used to collect items that usually consist of elements of multiple data types.	
       Arrays are also a vital component that collects several items of the same data type.

2	List cannot manage arithmetic operations.	
       Array can manage arithmetic operations.

 3	List consists of elements that belong to the different data types.	
       Array consists of elements that belong to the same data type.

 4	When it comes to flexibility, the list is perfect as it allows easy modification of data.	
       When it comes to flexibility, the array is not suitable as it does not allow easy 
       modification of data.

 5	List consumes a larger memory.
       Array consumes less memory than a list.

 6	In a list, the complete list can be accessed without any specific looping.	
       In an array, a loop is mandatory to access the components of the array.

 7	List favors a shorter sequence of data.	
       Array favors a longer sequence of data.
