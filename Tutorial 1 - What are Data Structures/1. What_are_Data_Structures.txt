What are Data Structures?
They are a specificied way to organise, manage, and store data in a specific memory layout. Similar 
to that of a physical container, which you can put and keep stuff in it. 

Like how,
house = building material + house building instructions,

computer program = Data Structures + code instructions (Algorithms)

Data Structures are the building materials/raw material to build any computer program. To build a 
good computer program, you need to have a sound understanding of Data Structures and which is the 
right Data Structure (building materials) to use to build a computer program (house). (Example in
2. using_the_right_data_structure.py)

Examples of Data Structures:
1. Arrays
2. Linked Lists
3. Hash Tables
4. Stacks
5. Queues
6. Trees
7. Graphs

Note: Different Data Structures store their data in memory in different ways:
E.g. 
Arrays store data in a continuous manner, each element side by side to one another in memory.

Hash Tables/Hash Maps/Dictionaries (in Python) puts the 'key' element through a hash function to 
retrieve its corresponding 'value' element.

Stack, Queue, Linked lists and Trees make use of the concept of 'pointers' to store and 
locate data.


Another way to think of how Data Structures store data is whether they store data Linearly or
Non-Linearly:

  Linear Data Structures   |   Non-Linear Data Structures
        Arrays             |            Trees
     Linked Lists          |            Graphs
      Hash Tables          |
        Stacks             |
        Queues             |

Note: Data Structures are a conceptual thing, different programming languages may or may not have
existing built-in of these Data Structures into their language (below are the built-in names in
the respective programming languages)
