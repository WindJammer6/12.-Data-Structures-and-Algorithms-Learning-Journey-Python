    #What this Instance Method does is that it does Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal operation on the Adjacency
    #List Directed Graph Data Structure.

    #For more technical explanation of how BFS is done on Adjacency List Graph Data Structures, refer to the section
    #'Explaining how Scanning/Traversal operation works in Graph' in '1. What_is_a_Graph.txt'.

    #These are the steps of BFS for Graph Data Structures:
        # 1. You can start from any node (only for Undirected Graphs, for Directed Graphs, you must start from the root
        #    node) in the Graph Data Structure. So, we will start by enqueuing any one of the Graphâ€™s nodes at the rear
        #    of the Queue.
        # 2. Now take the front item of the Queue and append it to the 'Visited' List.
        # 3. Create a List of that node's adjacent nodes. Enqueue all those which are not within the 'Visited' List and 
        #    Queue to the rear of the Queue. The adjacent nodes can be added in any order to the rear of the Queue. We
        #    will ignore the adjacent nodes that has already been visited before since they should already either be 
        #    in the 'Visited' List or is currently in the Queue already.
        # 4. Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 till the Queue is empty.

    #instead of an Undirected Graph Data Structure)
